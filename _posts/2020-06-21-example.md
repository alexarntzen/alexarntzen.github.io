Some code in python 

```python
def gcd(m,n):
    if m<n: 
        (m,n) = (n,m)
    if (m%n) == 0:
        return n 
    else:
        return gcd(n, m % n)
```
And this is some math:

#### The Radonâ€“Nikodym theorem: 
Let $$( X , \Sigma )$$ be a measure space with two $$\sigma$$-finite measures  $$\mu$$ and $$\nu$$. If $$\nu$$ is absolutly continious with respect to $$\mu$$. Then there exist a $$\Sigma$$ measureable function $$ f : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+ $$ such that for all $$ A \in \Sigma $$ 

$$ \nu (A)=\int _{A}f\,d\mu . $$

And of course $$ e^x$$
