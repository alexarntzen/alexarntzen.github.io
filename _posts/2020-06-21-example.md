Here are some words.

Some code in python 

```python
def gcd(m,n):
    if m<n: 
        (m,n) = (n,m)
    if (m%n) == 0:
        return n 
    else:
        return gcd(n, m % n)
```
And this is some math:

#### The Radon–Nikodym theorem: 
Let $$( X , \mathcal{A} )$$ be a measureable space with two $$\sigma$$-finite measures  $$\mu$$ and $$\nu$$. If $$\nu$$ is absolutly continious with respect to $$\mu$$. Then there exist a $$\mathcal{A}$$ measureable function $$ f : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+ $$ such that $$ \forall A \in \mathcal{A} $$ 

$$ \nu (A)=\int _{A}f\,d\mu . $$

And of course $$ e^x$$
